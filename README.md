# Connectors

Prototype code for node-edge graph connectors in SVG.

Initial implementation of Doug Schepers' proposed [SVG Connectors](https://dev.w3.org/SVG/modules/connector/SVGConnector.html) specification from 2011.

This repo is partly for posterity, but hopefully a jumping-off point for new progress on SVG Connectors.
